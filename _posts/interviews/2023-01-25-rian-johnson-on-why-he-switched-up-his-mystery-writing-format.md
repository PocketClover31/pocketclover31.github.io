In 'The Protégé' Maggie Q stars in the film as Anna, a girl who was rescued and raised by Moody (Samuel L. Jackson) and taught everything she knows. What audiences get a peek into is how that platonic father/daughter relationship is formed and strengthened all while Anna tries to deal with her past that was traumatizing but also fuels her. It’s the relationships that keep the action going—and there is plenty of action—and also what sets this film apart.
