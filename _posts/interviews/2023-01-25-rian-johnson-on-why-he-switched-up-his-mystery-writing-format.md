Rian Johnson is known for crafting intricate puzzles for some of his work including the ‘Knives Out’ franchise of films. But with this latest venture into the world of mystery, ‘Poker Face,’ the format for this new Peacock show starring Natasha Lyonne leaves the question of “Who’s the killer?” at the door and instead turns to ask “How did you catch them?”

Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who we see in the first episode working at a casino in Nevada when she gets thrust into the world of murder (not to reveal any spoilers on how). From then on out, she’s on the case and travels around solving crimes herself without a badge or detective background. Instead, she has an uncanny ability to detect lies which leads her down some pretty intense roads.

‘Poker Face’ also features a bevy of impressive guest stars—Adrien Brody, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Barkin, Nick Nolte and more join in—which was part of the appeal for writer/director Rian Johnson. And to dive a little deeper into the series, he sat down to discuss what’s in store for this new show, which premieres Jan. 26.
