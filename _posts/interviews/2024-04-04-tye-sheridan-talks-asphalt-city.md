If there’s one takeaway from ‘Asphalt City‘, Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire’s latest feature starring Tye Sheridan and Sean Penn, it’s that it feels hyperreal from the very first opening shot—and it doesn’t lose that lens for a second.

The film tells the tale of New York City paramedic Ollie Cross (Sheridan) and his ways of navigating the gritty and chaotic streets of Brooklyn along with his partner, Gene Rutkovsky (Penn). The story was originally based on the book ‘Black Flies’ by Shannon Burke, though what we see on screen is an accumulation of evolutions, according to its star, Sheridan.
